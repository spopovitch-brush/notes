## "The Ghost Particle: From Theory to KM3NeT's Record-Breaking Discovery"


### Scene 1
- *Location*: Floor 1 - where there are the sofas
- *Characters*: Student (Francesco), Physicist (Chien Shiung)
- *Music*: Some mountain Spanish song
  
**Francesco:** Hi Chien Shiung. I'm very curious about this new discovery I heard on the news, about a discovery near the city of Pachino, in the province of Syracuse. You're a physicist? Can you tell me more about it?

**Chien Shiung:** Ghost particles. We call them neutrinos.

**Francesco:** Ghosts? Are you serious?

**Chien Shiung:** Surely. Right now, trillions of them are passing through your body. And you can't feel a thing.

**Francesco:** That's incredible. How did we discover them?

**Chien Shiung:** Let me take you back to where it all began...

### Scene 2
- *Location*: Zürich, Switzerland - Physics conference room
- *Time*: December 1930
- *Characters*: Wolfgang Pauli (writing a letter), Felix Bloch (colleague)
- *Music*: Pineapple Rag - Scott Joplin

**PAULI:** (voiceover, writing) "Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen...I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the law of conservation of energy. Namely, the possibility that there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles, that I wish to call neutrons, which have spin 1/2 and obey the exclusion principle."

**BLOCH:** Wolfgang, an invisible particle? How can we ever prove it exists?

**PAULI:** Perhaps we never will. But the mathematics demands it.

[in a circle]

**FERMI:** I agree with Pauli, but let's call it neutrino, the little neutral one, to distinguish it from Chadwick's neutron.

[in another circle]

**Bohr:** No, I disagree. I would propose that energy conservation only held statistically, not in every individual decay.

[Transition to 1956]

- *Location*: Nuclear reactor facility, USA
- *Time*: 1956
- *Characters*: Reines and Cowan (scientists)
- *Music*: Mr. Sandman - The Chordettes

**REINES:** (excited, looking at detector readout) Frederick, look at this! After 26 years... we've finally caught one.

**COWAN:** Incredible! The neutrino is real!

### Scene 3
- *Location*: Floor 1 (with tablet showing detector images)
- *Characters*: Francesco, Chien Shiung

**Francesco:** Twenty-six years to find just one? That's more or less the same time Roma waited to win a championship from 1983!

**Chien Shiung:** (showing images) Exactly, what a specific reference, you always surprise me. That's why modern detectors are so big, deep underwater or in ice in the South Pole, waiting for that one-in-a-billion interaction (look the picture of IceCube)

**Francesco:** I do see, now. It seems very cold there, more than Frascati in January!

**Chien Shiung:** It nearly is. But when a high-energy neutrino hits water or ice, it creates a flash of light. That's what we hunt for.

### Scene 4
- *Location*: Floor 1 (with tablet showing detector images)
- *Characters*: Francesco, Chien Shiung

**Chien Shiung:** (excited) Last year, KM3NeT—a detector in the Mediterranean Sea—caught the highest-energy neutrino ever recorded from Earth. It is the discovery you heard about in the news.

**Francesco:** How much is the energy, you are talking about?

**Chien Shiung:** Think of it like this: if a regular neutrino is a whisper, this one was a shout heard across the universe. It came from billions of light-years away.

**Francesco:** What could create something that powerful?

**Chien Shiung:** That's what we're trying to figure out. Black holes, supernovae, something we haven't even imagined yet.

### Scene 5
- *Location*: KM3NeT Control Room in Sicily
- *Time*: 2023
- *Characters*: 2 Scientists (talking in italian english accent)
- *Music*: Musica Leggerissima - Colapesce, Dimartino

**Scientist 1:**: (pointing at screen) Here it is! The data from the KM3NeT. This neutrino traveled through space for billions of years before reaching us.

**Scientist 2:** And its energy is off the charts! This could open a new window into the most extreme events in the universe.

### Scene 6
- *Location*: Floor 1 (walking out)
- *Characters*: Francesco, Chien Shiung

**Francesco:** So these ghosts... they're a very important key to understanding the universe?

**Chien Shiung:** Exactly. It's like we are discovering a new chapter of a book we have never found before.

**Francesco:** (looking up) And they're passing through us right now?

**Chien Shiung:** Every second of every day. But we still don't know many things, we're only beginning to understand.

**Francesco:** Daje! Science is amazing.
